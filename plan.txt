Two 2D vectors of booleans, one for the map display, the other for working out the next state.
The calculation vector can be copied into the display vector at the end of the calcualtions.
Using a gamemap class that has the two vectors as attributes.
Class methods will be: gamemap() (constructor), run_game(), display_map(), calculate_state().
run_game() will loop between display_map() and calculate_state() to propagate the turns, moving the calculation vector into the display vector at the end of each turn.
The move can be done because the data in the calculation vector isn't needed again, and will be recalculated before next use.
